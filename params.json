{"name":"Cync","tagline":"A program written in C# that syncs music playlists to portable (and non-portable) devices","body":"## [Download - GitHub](https://github.com/opcon/Cync/releases)\r\n## [Download - Mediafire (binary only)](http://www.mediafire.com/download/fbi8honjj42hgfe/Cync-0.1.rar)\r\nLatest release is v0.1\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Supports multiple destinations, each with their own playlist prefix and naming template\r\n* Supports limits on the maximum amount of songs and minimum amount free space for each individual destination\r\n* Reads _most_ music files (*.mp3, *.flac, *.wav etc.). Tag reading is implemented using the wonderful [TagLib#](https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp)\r\n* Free and open source!\r\n* Clean interface\r\n* Supports multiple device profiles\r\n* Playlists are copied over to a specified directory, paths include the specified playlist root for each device\r\n* Reads device songs as well to prevent unneeded copying, will also include these in the resulting playlists if they are present in any of the input playlists\r\n* Collates multiple playlists: simply enter a bunch of folders, and Cync will merge them together to create a master syncing list! Alternatively you can select a playlist to use as the master.\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\nThis was built for my own personal use, but I'm hoping that it will help out other people.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy usage consists of a rockboxed Sansa ClipZip with a 32gb sdcard. Cync allows me to take full advantage of both the internal memory and the sdcard, as well as syncing playlists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far I have only tested this on my home machines with a small number of devices - while it functioned correctly there, I can not guarantee it will function correctly on your machine. I take no responsibility for any damages caused by this program, whether to your computer, device or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n**This is a BETA piece of software, please report any bugs to me; suggestions are also very welcome.**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
