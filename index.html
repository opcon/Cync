<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Supports multiple destinations, each with their own playlist prefix and naming template</li>
<li>Supports limits on the maximum amount of songs and minimum amount free space for each individual destination</li>
<li>Reads <em>most</em> music files (*.mp3, *.flac, *.wav etc.). Tag reading is implemented using the wonderful <a href="https://github.com/mono/taglib-sharp">TagLib#</a>
</li>
<li>Free and open source!</li>
<li>Clean interface</li>
<li>Supports multiple device profiles</li>
<li>Playlists are copied over to a specified directory, paths include the specified playlist root for each device</li>
<li>Reads device songs as well to prevent unneeded copying, will also include these in the resulting playlists if they are present in any of the input playlists</li>
<li>Collates multiple playlists: simply enter a bunch of folders, and Cync will merge them together to create a master syncing list! Alternatively you can select a playlist to use as the master.</li>
</ul><h3>

<p>This was built for my own personal use, but I'm hoping that it will help out other people.</p>

<p><strong>Currently only supports m3u8 playlists (although this could just be normal m3u playlists, I haven't tested it with unicode. Anyway, it will only find playlists matching *.m3u8. Also only uses playlists for file paths, does not read any of the 'extra' stuff that goes into m3u playlists.</strong></p>

<p>My usage consists of a rockboxed Sansa ClipZip with a 32gb sdcard. Cync allows me to take full advantage of both the internal memory and the sdcard, as well as syncing playlists.</p>

<p>So far I have only tested this on my home machines with a small number of devices - while it functioned correctly there, I can not guarantee it will function correctly on your machine. I take no responsibility for any damages caused by this program, whether to your computer, device or otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>This is a BETA piece of software, please report any bugs to me; suggestions are also very welcome.</strong></p>
